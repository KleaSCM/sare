echo "ðŸŒ¸ Testing Sare CD Command Fix! ðŸŒ¸"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

echo "The issue was:"
echo "  - Command 'cd ..' was getting mangled"
echo "  - Error message was being concatenated to the command"
echo "  - Path parsing wasn't handling '..' properly"
echo ""

echo "âœ… Fixed issues:"
echo "  - Added proper path cleaning with .trim()"
echo "  - Added explicit handling for '..' parent directory"
echo "  - Improved error handling with proper error messages"
echo "  - Added support for absolute paths starting with '/'"
echo ""

echo "ðŸš€ Now 'cd ..' should work perfectly!"
echo "ðŸ’• Sare's command parsing is now more robust!"
