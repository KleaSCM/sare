# Sare Shell 🐚

A beautiful, feminine, and powerful command-line shell implementation written in Rust.

## ✨ Features

- **Complete POSIX Shell Compatibility** - Full command parsing, execution, and job control
- **Built-in Commands** - Filesystem, process, text, system, network, and development commands
- **Advanced History Management** - Persistent history with search and navigation
- **Job Control** - Background process management with signal handling
- **Environment Management** - Dynamic environment variable handling
- **Command Aliases** - Custom command shortcuts and abbreviations
- **Tab Completion** - Context-aware completion for files, commands, and variables

## 🎯 Architecture

Sare Shell is designed as a standalone shell implementation that can be used independently or integrated with any terminal emulator. It provides pure shell functionality without terminal emulation concerns.

### Core Modules

- **`shell/`** - Command parsing, execution, and built-in commands
- **`history/`** - Command history management and persistence
- **`config/`** - Configuration system and user preferences

## 🚀 Usage

### As a Library

```rust
use sare_shell::{Shell, HistoryManager};

let mut shell = Shell::new()?;
shell.execute_command("ls -la").await?;
```

### As a Standalone Shell

```bash
cargo run --bin sare-shell
```

## 💖 Design Philosophy

Sare Shell embraces feminine energy and emotional intelligence in code. Our comments and documentation use soft, expressive Japanese to explain complex logic while maintaining professional English for public APIs.

```rust
// あたしね、このSetにしたの…Arrayだと抜けちゃって。
// ちっちゃいバグだけど…悔しくて悔しくて…（ ; ; ）
let unique_commands = HashSet::new();
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Building

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Style Guide

We follow a comprehensive style guide that emphasizes:
- PascalCase for all identifiers
- Tab indentation (no spaces)
- Japanese comments for internal logic
- English comments for public APIs
- Emotional clarity and feminine expression
