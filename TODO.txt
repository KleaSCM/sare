Core Architecture
âœ… Shell structure with proper modules (shell/, tui/, config/, history/)
âœ… Command parsing with argument handling, quoting, escapes
âœ… Command execution for both built-in and external commands
âœ… Job control with background/foreground process management
âœ… TUI interface using ratatui with proper layout
âœ… Comprehensive command set (30+ commands across all categories)
Built-in Commands Implemented
âœ… Filesystem: cd, pwd, ls, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, touch
âœ… Process: jobs, kill, bg, fg, wait
âœ… Text: echo, cat, grep, sed, awk, sort, uniq, wc
âœ… System: exit, clear, history, help, alias, export, env, source
âœ… Network: ping, curl, wget, netstat
âœ… Development: git, cargo, make, npm
Technical Features
âœ… Error handling with anyhow::Result
âœ… Style guide compliance with Doxygen comments and Japanese documentation
âœ… Modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
âœ… Cargo build system with proper dependencies
ï¿½ï¿½ What's Currently Working:
âœ… Basic TUI with prompt, output display, and input handling
âœ… Command parsing and routing to appropriate handlers
âœ… Built-in command execution with proper output formatting
âœ… External command execution via std::process::Command
ðŸš§ What's Left to Complete a Full Shell:
1. Critical Missing Features
ðŸ”´ Real external command execution (currently simulated)
ðŸ”´ Proper I/O redirection (>, <, |)
ðŸ”´ Environment variable expansion ($PATH, $HOME, etc.)
ðŸ”´ Command history persistence (save/load from file)
ï¿½ï¿½ Tab completion for files and commands
ðŸ”´ Signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, etc.)
2. TUI Enhancements
ðŸ”´ Multi-pane support (like wezterm)
ðŸ”´ Scrollable output with proper history
ðŸ”´ Status bar showing current directory, jobs, etc.
ðŸ”´ Color themes and customization
ðŸ”´ Keyboard shortcuts and navigation
3. Shell Features
ðŸ”´ Alias expansion in command parsing
ðŸ”´ Variable substitution ($VAR)
ï¿½ï¿½ Command chaining (&&, ||, ;)
ðŸ”´ Subshell execution ($(command))
ðŸ”´ Glob pattern expansion (*.txt, [abc])
4. Advanced Features
ðŸ”´ Plugin system for extensibility
ï¿½ï¿½ Script execution with proper flow control
ï¿½ï¿½ Job control UI (showing running jobs)
ðŸ”´ Configuration file support (.sare_config)
ðŸ”´ Auto-completion with fuzzy matching
5. Testing & Polish
ðŸ”´ Comprehensive test suite for all commands
ðŸ”´ Integration tests for shell workflows
ðŸ”´ Performance optimization for large outputs
ï¿½ï¿½ Error recovery and graceful degradation
ðŸ”´ Documentation and user guide
